            <p>I have developed a strong technical ability during my Degree. I started learning programming with Java and have completed modules in Object Orientated Programming and Algorithms and Data Structures. Many modules required me to have a good understanding of programming including mobile app development and games development.
My degree has also helped me develop strong project management and presentation skills as I have completed many projects throughout the years solo and with a team. Pitching projects to the class was also an important part of some modules.
I would relish the opportunity to work with a team on software projects were I will utilise these skills and develop them more.
